## 💾 Local Storage
This app uses local storage to save the tasks between sessions. This means that if you close the browser and reopen it later, the tasks you added will still be there. However, please note that local storage is browser-specific, so if you switch to a different browser or device, the tasks may not be there.

## 🛠️ Technical Details
This app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the jQuery library for some of the DOM manipulation and event handling. The tasks are stored in local storage using the localStorage API, which is available in modern web browsers.
